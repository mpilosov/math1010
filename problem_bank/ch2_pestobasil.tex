You are planning to make pesto and need to buy basil.  At the grocery store, you can buy small containers of basil priced at 
\$2.99 for each 2/3-ounce container.  At the farmerâ€™s market, you can buy basil in bunches for \$12 per pound.  Which is the better deal?

\leftline{\bf Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Step 1.  Think \emph{What does it mean to be the ``better deal?'' What kind of problem might we solve to figure this out?} 
The units involved in the problem are \underline{\hspace{1in}} and \underline{\hspace{1in}} and \underline{\hspace{1in}}.
	To compare the prices, we need them both in the same units.  We have a choice here.  They could both be in the units \underline{\hspace{1in}} or in \underline{\hspace{1in}}.

\item Step 2. Convert the small container price to a \emph{price per pound} to answer the question.

Step 3. Has the answer come out with the units we expect?  Does the answer make sense? \emph{How else might we have done the problem?}
